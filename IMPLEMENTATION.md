## 📝 Content Files Created

All content files are in `src/content/`:

- `publications.yaml` - Academic publications
- `talks.yaml` - Conference talks

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is ready for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. **Push to GitHub**: Push this repository to your GitHub account
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: GitHub Actions
3. **Automatic Deployment**: The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically build and deploy on every push to `main`

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Update Content**: 
   - Edit YAML files in `src/content/` with your actual information
   - Replace placeholder GPG key in `public/gpg/current.asc`
   - Update social links in `content/social.yaml`

2. **Customize Colors**: 
   - Edit `src/config.ts` to update color scheme
   - Colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`

3. **Add Your GPG Key**:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID > public/gpg/current.asc
   ```
   Then update `src/content/gpg.yaml` with key details

4. **Add Articles**: 
   - Create Markdown files in `src/content/articles/`
   - See `src/content/articles/example.md` for format

5. **Test Locally** (requires Node.js 18.20.8+ or 20+):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## ⚠️ Note on Node.js Version

The build requires Node.js 18.20.8+ or 20+. If your local Node.js is older:
- The code is correct and will work on GitHub Actions (which uses Node 20)
- You can upgrade Node.js locally, or
- Just push to GitHub and let Actions handle the build
