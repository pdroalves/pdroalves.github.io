abstract: 'Under the dominant cloud computing paradigm, employing encryption for data storage and transport may not be enough. Security guarantees should also be extended to data processing. Homomorphic encryption schemes are natural candidates for computation over encrypted data since they are able to satisfy the requirements imposed by the cloud environment. This work presents CUYASHE as a GPGPU implementation of the leveled fully homomorphic scheme YASHE. It employs CUDA, the Chinese Remainder Theorem and the Fast Fourier Transform to obtain significant performance improvements. In particular, there was a speedup between 6 and 35 times for homomorphic multiplication.'
