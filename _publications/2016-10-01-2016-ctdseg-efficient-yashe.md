abstract: 'Under the dominant cloud computing paradigm, employing encryption for data storage and transport may not be enough for assurance of secrecy, because the data owner has no real control over the processing hardware. This way,security guarantees should also be extended to data processing.  Homomorphic encryption schemes are natural candidates for computation over encrypted data in the cloud, since they are able to satisfy all security requirements imposed by that environment. This work investigates strategies to efficiently implement the leveled fully homomorphic scheme YASHE on GPGPUs. As result of this research, the CUYASHE library was developed and made available to the community.  In particular, it presents a speedup between 6 and 35 times for homomorphic multiplication. This operation is performance-critical for evaluating any function over encrypted data, demonstrating that GPGPUs are an appropriate technology for bootstrapping privacy-preserving cloud computing environments.'
