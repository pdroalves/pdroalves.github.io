abstract: 'Under the dominant cloud computing paradigm, employing encryption fordata storage and transport may not be enough. Security guarantees should also be extended to data processing, to preserve the privacy of data owners and contractors. Homomorphic encryption schemes are a natural candidate for computing over encrypted data, satisfying these new security requirements. In this work, CUYASHE is presented as a GPGPU implementation of the leveled fully homomorphic scheme YASHE. The implementation employs the CUDA platform, the Chinese Remainder Theorem and the Fast Fourier Transform to obtain significant performance improvements.  When compared with the state-of-the-art implementation in CPUs, speedups of 20% for homomorphic addition and 58% for multiplication were observed. These operations are performance-critical for evaluating any function over encrypted data, demonstrating that GPUs are an appropriate technology for bootstraping privacy-preserving cloud computing environments.'
