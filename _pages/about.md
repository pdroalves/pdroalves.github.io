I am a Senior GPU Engineer at [Zama](https://www.zama.ai/), where I work on accelerating privacy-preserving technologies, with a focus on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). My main expertise lies in cryptography, high-performance computing, and GPU programming (CUDA, Rust, C++), and I contribute to Zamaâ€™s open-source FHE libraries and blockchain solutions.

I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, all from the University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil. During my Ph.D., supervised by Professor Diego Aranha, I specialized in privacy-preserving computing, particularly cryptography and functional encryption. 

Between 2021 and 2022, I was a visiting researcher at the Aarhus Crypto Group, Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University, Denmark. Today, my work continues to bridge applied cryptography and high-performance systems, helping bring advanced cryptographic tools closer to real-world deployment.
