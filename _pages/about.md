I'm a PhD candidate at the Institute of Computing of University of Campinas, Brazil. My supervisor is [Professor Diego Aranha](https://sites.google.com/site/dfaranha).

I have a bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics and MSc in Computer Science from the University of Campinas. My research interests aim privacy preserving computing, in particular cryptography and functional encryption; and high performance computing. Furthermore, I have works in geophysics and biology on the development of specialized software using CUDA platform. 

I'm visiting [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup) at the Department of Computer Science of Aarhus University, Denmark, until September 2021.
