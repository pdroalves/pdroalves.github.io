I have a bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics and MSc in Computer Science from the University of Campinas. My research interests aim privacy preserving computing, in particular cryptography and functional encryption; and high performance computing. Furthermore, I have works in geophysics and biology on the development of specialized software using CUDA platform.
