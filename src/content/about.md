# About Me

I am Pedro Alves, a PhD in Computer Science with a passion for privacy-preserving technologies, homomorphic encryption, and secure cloud computing.

My research focuses on developing efficient implementations of cryptographic schemes, particularly homomorphic encryption, to enable computation over encrypted data without compromising privacy. I have worked extensively with GPGPU implementations using CUDA to accelerate cryptographic operations.

I am passionate about open-source software and believe in making privacy-preserving technologies accessible to everyone.

Onwards!
